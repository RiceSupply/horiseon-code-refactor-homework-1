# Horiseon Refractoring Project-1

## Description

As software engineers and those who code, we should practice avoiding unnecessary code within our work.  With this project, I decreased the amount of repetitive and unnecessary code while still maintaining the functionality from an already existing website.  I did this, not only to optimize the website to the best of my ability, but also to practice HTML and CSS integration. This project taught me the benefits of grouping class systems that will be affected similarily within a website.  I hope this project inspires others to continue adjusting their code to maximize the efficiency of their work. 

## Technologies

I used HTML and CSS in order to adjust the available code.  I also added a gitignore file during the class example with my instructor.  Nestled in the assests are the images seen on the website.

## Instalation

N/A

## Usage

In order to get a better understanding of the project, a user should browse the HTML file using their default web browser.  With this page open, select the insepct tool and open the DevTools console.  This will allow you to adjust the values and properties of the code while linking it back to the CSS and HTML files. By simply refreshing the page, the code will return to its original state.  If you practice adjusting code on the actual files, be sure to refresh your web page frequently to see the changes.
